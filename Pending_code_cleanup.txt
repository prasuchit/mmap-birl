Clean up the way observations are obtained, obsv model is saved, sampled trajectories are generated(number of them is chosen)
Add sanet_traj vs synthetic_traj as an argument in the beginning instead of inside generate trajectory within generator.
Make the MDP files independent of the rest of it and allow a YAML load of MDP and trajectories.
Clean up parallel_processing and sparse arguments all over.
Get a readme setup with the additional packages to install like tqdm and pymdptoolbox linked to it.
Try adding very small non-zero transitions for all other states than the probable ones to avoid divide by zero type errors
