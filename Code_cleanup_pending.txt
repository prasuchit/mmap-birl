Get rid of Roll behavior if possible!
Clean up the way observations are obtained, obsv model is saved, sampled trajectories are generated(number of them is chosen)
Add sanet_traj vs synthetic_traj as an argument in the beginning instead of inside generate trajectory within generator.
Make the MDP files independent of the rest of it and allow a YAML load of MDP and trajectories.
Add command-line arguments for hyperparameters, with a help flag detailing what they are.
Clean up parallel_processing and sparse arguments all over.
Get a readme setup with the additional packages to install like tqdm and pymdptoolbox linked to it.
==================================================================================================================

The MDP uses a very clean transition from one action-state to the next instead of a continuous state space where
we go through other intermediate states to get to the finished action state.
In order to use SANet trajectories in the future, either SANet should know when an action is completed and only then 
give me a next state, or the MDP has to be modified to include these intermidiate states where you'd do a no-op.
FUCKING SAURABH!!
