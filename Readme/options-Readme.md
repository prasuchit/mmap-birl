This file contains 5 classes viz. algorithm, demonstration, trajinfo, irloptions and problem, which as the names suggest, hold the different
attributes needed to define the algorithm, the demonstrations, trajectory info, iRL options and the problem itself respectively. To understand 
more about the attributes and what they mean in the context of IRL, read this [survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06877).
